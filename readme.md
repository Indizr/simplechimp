# SimpleChimp (Beta)

SimpleChimp is a template for HTML email updates, optimized for MailChimp.

I use SimpleChimp for the Indizr email newsletter about Web 3.0 technology. Figured I should share it on an open source basis as well. (If you'd like to check out Indizr, subscribe at https://bit.ly/2SEp2Em )

SimpleChimp is, and always will be, free to use under MIT license. It is under active development, so we welcome feedback, pull requests, bug reports, etc. via https://github.com/indizr/simplechimp/
